R = rotz(0.1) * roty(0.2) * rotz(0.3);

%rotation to euler

gamma = tr2eul(R) 

% problem if theta is negative, different angles are returned but same rotation matrix

R = eul2r(0.1 , -0.2, 0.3) 
tr2eul(R)  

% problematic since mapping from a rotation matrix to Euler angles is not unique and the Toolbox always returns a positive angle for Î¸
